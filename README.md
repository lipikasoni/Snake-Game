# Snake-Game
This is a classic Snake game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a snake that the player controls to eat food, grow longer, and earn points. The goal is to achieve the highest score without colliding with the boundaries of the game canvas or the snake's own body.

Features
Snake Movement: Control the snake's direction using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Food: Colorful food appears randomly on the canvas for the snake to eat.
Scoring: Each time the snake eats food, the player earns points.
Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the canvas boundaries or itself.
